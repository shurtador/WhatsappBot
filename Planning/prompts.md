## Prompt to start a new phase
Based on the @prd.md, now that the Phase 1 & 2 have been completed, please analyze the requirements for Phase 3 and come up with an organized and detailed list of tasks/todos to complete this phase. Document it in detail in the PRD by adding subtasks where necessary so we can tackle the whole phase successfully.

Do you have any questions that you'd like me to clarify before diving in?
