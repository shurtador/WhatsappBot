## Prompt to create plan for a new phase
Based on the @prd.md, now that the Phase 1 & 2 have been completed, please analyze the requirements for Phase 3 and come up with an organized and detailed list of tasks/todos to complete this phase. Document it in detail in the PRD by adding subtasks where necessary so we can tackle the whole phase successfully.

Do you have any questions that you'd like me to clarify before diving in?

## Prompt to start development on a sub-phase already planned
Based on the information defined in @prd.md for [INSERT PHASE HERE], please review the details of the tasks you're about to embark on, check that you have full clarity in everything needed to tackle these and ask any clarification questions before starting the development.

Please present a plan on how you'll tackle these things so I can be aligned with you and once approved by me, you'll get to building.
